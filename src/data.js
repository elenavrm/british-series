            description: "Its sixth and final season has been released on Netflix and wrapped up the story of the Shelby crime family of Small Heath, Birmingham — at least for now. The ending of the show leaves an avenue to exploit what one might expect in the spin-off feature film that has been planned by creator Steven Knight. The final season is filled with a lot of loss and trauma, and there is even a bit of redemption thrown in for good measure. It wouldn’t be Peaky Blinders if there were not a few twists along the show’s journey to its end."
